## Def

Uses built in prototype functionality of JavaScript


### Pros

 + Leverages built in JS features.
 + "Modularize" code into 're-usable' components
 + Vars/functions taken out of global namespace.
 + Function loaded into memory into once. 
 + 'Overriding' functions using prototype.
 
### Cons
 
 + 'this' can be tricky.
 + Constructor separate from prototype definition.
