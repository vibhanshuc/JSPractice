## Def

Provides encapsulation (private and public members and methods)

### Pros

 + "Modularize" code into 're-usable' components.
 + Vars/functions taken out of global namespace.
 + exposes only public members while hiding private members.
 
### Cons
 
 + 'this' can be tricky.
 + Constructor separate from prototype definition.
